#TODO

1 Upsampling buffers data
1.1 DONE Create GPU kernel to upsample data
1.2 DONE Implement changes to framework to use larger data buffer
1.3 Implement changes into beamforming algorithms
1.3.1 CPU Beamforming
1.3.2 GPU Beamforming

2 Change buffer/aquisition to aquire 32 channels before changing focal zones.
2.1 Buffer Count and Record per Buffer will need to be changed
2.2 Beamforming algorithms need to be updated to reflect new references
2.2.1 CPU Beamforming
2.2.2 GPU Beamforming

3 Continuous recieve beamforming needs to be implemented.
3.1 Change delay making program (_calcDelays) to return a matrix instead of a vector
3.2 Update beamforming algorithms to take new delay index
3.2.1 CPU Beamforming
3.2.2 GPU Beamforming

4 Demodulate data after beamforming. 
4.1 Change framework to beamform full data
4.2 Implement IQ demodulation, decimate during demodulation

5 Use more complex beamforming algorithms
